# Does happiness result in higher life expectancy?

## Goal
My group wants to understand the relationship between happiness and life expectancy. We know that life expectancy is greatly tied to economic factors such as access to healthcare, housing, and food, but we also want to understand the impact of psychological factors such as happiness. Luckily for us, there exists a dataset mapping happiness to life expectancy by country. This analysis will provide a visualization of the relationship between happiness and life expectancy, allowing us to understand questions such as “Should we focus our efforts more on improving psychological wellbeing internationally in addition to economic efforts?”.

For this analysis, we are using data from the World Happines Report, which "uses global survey data to report how people evaluate their own lives in more than 150 countries worldwide". The years sampled are 2020 and 2021. From this dataset, we gather data by country on life expectancy (measured in years) and happiness score, which is based on a 0-10 rating scale in which 10 corresponds to the best possible life imaginable by the respondents and 0 corresponds to the worst.

## Conclusion
Based on the data above, there is a clear positive correlation between happiness and life expectancy. This can be seen clearly in the scatterplot, where happiness and life expectancy are correlated, and to a lesser extent in the map visualization, where countries with higher happiness scores tend to have greater life expectancies. While there are clearly a number of confounding factors that may affect both happiness and life expectancy which are not accounted for in the visualizations, it may be worth the time for organizations dedicated to longevity and wellbeing across the world to focus on happiness in addition to other economic factors.
